Reduced Order Model for Urban Climate Simulation

This project focuses on developing a Reduced Order Model (ROM) for predicting high-resolution urban climate variables using weather station data. The goal is to replace computationally expensive CFD-based multiphysics simulations with a faster, data-driven approach for estimating urban microclimate variables such as:
- Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT)
- Air Temperature (AT)
- Wind Speed Magnitude (MagVel)

The ROM leverages a combination of clustering techniques to select representative weather scenarios, and machine learning models trained on simulation data to approximate hourly climate conditions across an urban domain.
